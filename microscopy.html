		<div id="true"> MICROSCOPY

		HIV propagates by taking over host cells and using them to produce <em>more</em> viruses by embedding it's <div class="tooltip">DNA <span class="tooltiptext">DNA is the sequence of ~3 billion pairs of coding 'bases' that instruct your genetic information</span></div> into host cell <div class="tooltip">nuclei<span class="tooltiptext">Nuclei (singular <em>nucleus</em>) are the 'brains' of each cell, where the DNA exists</span></div>. Once embedded, viral DNA is transcribed by host polymerases to produce HIV proteins and eventually, new virions. However, HIV encodes all of it's 15 or so proteins in one very small piece of polycistronic DNA, and it uses alternative splicing to codify this diversity. Therefore, many HIV transcripts are <em>intronic</em>. In homeostatic conditions, intronic RNA is sequestered in the nucleus to avoid expression of faulty proteins. HIV counters this by expressing Rev. Rev can enter the nucleus, bind viral RNA transcripts via a hairpin region in the second intron in the transcript, and transport RNA to the cytoplasm to be translated.

		But what else does Rev do? We don't really know! I try to answer this question in my research:
			<ul>
				<li>Which host cell proteins does Rev interact with and what do these interactions do?</li>
				<li>Where does Rev live in the cell across infection and what does this tell us about it's function?</li>
				<li>Does Rev bind to host RNA as well as viral RNA? If so, which RNA and why</li>
			</ul>
