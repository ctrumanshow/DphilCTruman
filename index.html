		<div id="true"> In the Castello lab, our work focuses on the biochemistry of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) - the well-known pathogen responsible for the AIDS crisis. My work focuses specifically on a crucial HIV-1 protein called Rev. Rev is a small protein that is <em>essential</em> for viral replication - without Rev, HIV-1 cannot replicate efficiently! Why is Rev so essential?<br><br>

		HIV propagates by taking over host cells and using them to produce <em>more</em> viruses by embedding it's <div class="tooltip">DNA <span class="tooltiptext">DNA is the sequence of ~3 billion pairs of coding 'bases' that instruct your genetic information</span></div> into host cell <div class="tooltip">nuclei<span class="tooltiptext">Nuclei (singular <em>nucleus</em>) are the 'brains' of each cell, where the DNA is found.</span></div>. Once embedded, viral DNA is <div class="tooltip">transcribed by host polymerases<span class="tooltiptext">A polymerase is an enzyme responsible for copying DNA into RNA which becomes protein</span></div> to produce HIV proteins and eventually, new virions. However, HIV encodes all of it's 15 or so proteins in one very small piece of <div class="tooltip">polycistronic DNA<span class="tooltiptext">Polycistronic DNA encodes multiple proteins from the same piece of genetic information</span></div>, and it uses alternative splicing to codify this diversity. Therefore, many HIV transcripts are <div class="tooltip"><em>intronic</em><span class="tooltiptext">Intronic RNA is RNA which contains introns - or regions of genetic information that is not directly protein-coding</span></div>. In homeostatic conditions, intronic RNA is sequestered in the nucleus to avoid expression of faulty proteins. HIV counters this by expressing Rev. Rev can enter the nucleus, bind viral RNA transcripts via a hairpin region in the second intron in the transcript, and transport RNA to the cytoplasm to be translated. This vital role served by Rev is well known, though not still fully understood.

		But what else does Rev do? I try to answer this question in my research, for example:
			<ul>
				<li>Which host cell proteins does Rev interact with and what do these interactions do?</li>
				<li>Where does Rev transport to and from in the cell during infection and what does this tell us about it's function?</li>
				<li>Does Rev bind to host RNA as well as viral RNA? If so, which RNA and why?</li>
			</ul>
