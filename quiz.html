	var MA = " You got Rev! Rev is an amazing protein that contains multimerisation motifs, allowing it to \n \
	bind to multiple copies of itself. Like Rev, you tend to stick to people who are similar to you. Rev also \n \
	contains nuclear localisation and export signals so it can cycle between the nucleus and cytoplasm to move\n \
	intronic HIV RNA to the cytoplasm for translation. Like Rev, you're a little bit of a revolving door in \n \
	social situations, never hanging around too long."
	var MB = " You got the GagPol precursor protein! Gagpol encodes for the essential structural proteins \n \
	as well as the enzymes needed for HIV-1 to replicate. Like gagpol, you are a rich tapestry of interests \n \
	and skills - and when you're not around, a party just isn't the same! Gagpol mediates the nucleation \n \
	events required for viral assembly at the plasma membrane. Similarly, you are great at getting groups \n \
	of people together "
	var MC = " You got Vif! Vif protein is an accessory viral protein named after: viral infectivity factor. \n \
	It's a small, fully-spliced protein that inhibits APOBEC3 host defense enzymes, which hypermutate the HIV \n \
	in an attempt to nullify infection! Vif recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase to destroy these defensive \n \
	proteins. Like Vif, you are small, tough and always look out for your friends. "
	var MD = " You got Env! The envelope polyprotein is cleaved to produece 2 vital proteins: gp160, \n \
	which acts as the outer coating of the HIV-1 virion, and gp120, which is the glycoprotein responsible \n \
	for attaching to CD4 receptors on the surface of T cells and macrophages. Like Env, you are a great \n \
	initiator of conversations and are good at opening people up! "
